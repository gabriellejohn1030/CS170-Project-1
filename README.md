# CS170-Project-1

Given a data set with two classes and various features, program determines combination of features that yield the most accurate classifications

Classification is done with the nearest neighbor algorithm and tested with one-out cross validation 

Utilized greedy algorithms - Forward Selection and Backwards Elimination - in order to determine most accurate set of features to conduct classification with
